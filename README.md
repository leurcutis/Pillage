#PILLAGE!

Welcome to the world of **PILLAGE!**  

Pillage is a two player arena combat game, set on a circular board made 
of hexagons.

At the start of the game each player is given three characters to pit 
against each other in brutal arena combat.

Each character has it's own unique qualities, which consist of maximum
rate of movement, rate of attack, and total hit points.

##Starting the game
When the game starts, each player has three characters to use as they
will to move around the board and inflict damage on their opponent's
characters. They are placed in their starting positions on either side
of the board.

##Winning the game
The player with the last character standing wins the game.

##The Characters
Currently there are only three characters Each player only gets to use
these three:

* **The Goblin** | 
    * Movement : 3 squares
    * Hit Points : 5
    * Attacks : 1, only adjacent squares

* **The Juggernaut** |
    * Movement : 1 square
    * Hit Points : 9
    * Attacks : 2, 
        + Only adjacent squares, 
        + Can either split up attacks on separate opponents
        (if available) or can spend both attacks on a single 
        opponent

* **The Wizard** |
    * Movement : 2 squares
    * Hit Points : 7
    * Attacks : 1, Can attack within a two square radius
        + As a ranged attack
        + or adjacent squares

##Movement and engaging in Combat
    * Player 1 moves their characters at the character's move rate
    or (counter attack if they are engaged in combat)
    
    * If a character encounters another character, they may attack
    
    * Oppenents who have been attacked can counter attack
    
    * Player 2 moves their characters at the character's move rate
    or (counter attack if they are engaged in combat)
    
    * If combat has taken place, total available hitpoints are adjusted
    
    * In order to attack, the player must first click on the unit they wish
    to attack with, then click on the unit they wish to attack
    
    * Damage is automatic
 
##Combat (and how it works)
    * When a character moves into a square adjacent to an opponent, the
    two opposing characters engage in Combat
    
    * The player who's character's move action provokes a Combat gets to
    attack first 
    
    * If there are multiple characters in adjacent spaces the 
    moving/attacking character must pick only one opponent to engage in 
    combat with, unless that character has the ability to attack
    multiple targets during thier turn
    
    * Following, the character just attacked gets to deliver a return blow
    
    * If there are multiple characters in adjacent spaces each one gets to
    engage in one attack of opprotunity on the infiltrator
    
    * Hit points are decremented accordingly
    
    * Each individual attack only does one point of damage
